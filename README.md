# MaaAssistantStarRail

This is a small toy python repo inspired by the idea of MaaAssistantArknights. But the code is completely irrelevant to the original Maa project.

Examples can be found in the main.py

# Auto tasks

use GameTasks.doTask(f"taskSub{tabIndex}", f"taskSub{taskIndex}", num) to automatically do tasks.
Currently taskTab2-6 is supported.

# Map location finding

Use MapNavigation.update() to get the real-time location of the tiny map. In debugMode, the location will be illustrated in the Screen/debug.jpg.
